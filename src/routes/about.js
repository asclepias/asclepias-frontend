            <h1>About the Asclepias Project</h1>

            <p className="pt-3 fs-5">
                Discovery in astronomy is being driven by the development of new software tools within every aspect of our science. The Asclepias project, a project of the AAS, NASA ADS, and Zenodo, was born out of scientists' need to distribute, discover, and track software as it is used in astronomy.  This tool allows you to connect the software tools and the scientific results, making your progress faster, more open, and reproducible.
            </p>

            <p className="pt-1 fs-5">
                The development of the code for the Asclepias project is entirely open-source and freely available on the <a href="https://github.com/asclepias">GitHub repository</a>. Extensive documentation on the Asclepias Broker, including the structure of how it connects citations is available at the <a href="https://asclepias-broker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Read the Docs</a> page.

            <h3 className="pt-5">How do Software Entries make it into Asclepias</h3>
            <p className="pt-1 fs-5">
            All software that appears in Asclepias is cited by an academic publication (or ArXiv preprint) that appears in the <a href="http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu">Astrophysics Data System</a>. The citation should use, preferably, a Digital Object Identifier (or DOI), or a GitHub repository link (to a repository as a whole, or a specific release). We recommend uploading a version of your software to <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>, which can import the specific version of your software from GitHub, and generates a DOI to cite. The first time the software is cited in a publication, it will be "harvested" by Asclepias, and will be available to be found!
